1. Easiest and simplest method for installing Git is to use a package manager. We will use **homebrew**. To install homebrew, go [here](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/releases/) and click on **latest**.
2. At the bottom of the page you will find a **.pkg** file in the **assets** section. Download the file.
3. Install the file, which should be titled similar to this: _homebrew-?.?.?.pkg_.
4. Open the terminal app on your Mac (_command-space_, then **terminal**).
5. Type **brew --version**. If you successfully installed homebrew, you will see its version number appear.
6. Now install **git** by typing **brew install git**
7. Type **git --version**. Again, if successful, you will see the version number for git.
# Become a GitHub user
If you are already here, you probably already have a username and password for GitHub. If not, get one!
# Connect PyCharm to Git
Look at the menu at the top of PyCharm: if you see VCS (which stands for Version Control System), open that menu and follow the prompts to create a GitHub repository. If PyCharm does not recognize that Git is installed, restart PyCharm.
